# terminal42/contao-mailusername

With this Contao extension, a members username will be set to its email
address. A member no longer needs to give a username when registering
through the front end registration module.

Usernames for existing members are not changed, but their username will
be converted to the email address the next time their data is updated
(e.g. through back end or personal data front end module).

**Attention:** Before installing this extension into an existing system
with members, make sure there are no members with duplicate email
addresses!
